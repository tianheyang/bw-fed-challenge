# Tianhe Yang, Front End Developer Challenge

Hi there 👋️ I've built this app with Gatsby and React, since Gatsby's native `createPages` API seemed like a perfect fit for this project. To run this project locally:

* Install Gatsby with `npm install -g gatsby-cli`
* Install dependencies with `npm install`
* Start development mode with `gatsby develop` and view the site on [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
